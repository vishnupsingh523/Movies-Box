        <span>Plot</span>
        <p>
            In New Delhi, a mysterious sniper is contacted by an aged secret agent, V.K. Naidu (Mohit Chauhan), to kill a target from a distance. However, the sniper instead shoots Naidu, and escapes, and is thus shown to be rogue former Research and Analysis Wing agent Kabir (Hrithik Roshan), considered one of the agency's best.<br><br>

            Shortly after Kabir's boss and RAW joint secretary, Colonel Sunil Luthra (Ashutosh Rana), relays his betrayal to Defence Minister Sherna Patel, she calls for the agency to summon Khalid Rahmani (Tiger Shroff), a RAW agent who was previously mentored by Kabir and is in complete awe of the former agent. A flashback shows Khalid's introduction to Kabir, who questions Sunil about Khalid's loyalty to the nation, arguing that Khalid's late father, Abdul Rahmani, proved himself a traitor both to the nation and Kabir himself when he shot him. However, in full awe of Kabir, who he regards as a major inspiration, Khalid insists that he will serve his country, no matter what, and regain his family's honour.<br><br>

            During the conversation between the two that follows a highly crucial and intense mission which turns out to be a success, Kabir takes Khalid to account after noticing his one-sided aim, to which Khalid responds by citing that his father's treason resulted in him being severely smashed in the right eye by a school bully, which impaired his vision. Kabir, however, reveals that he was indeed testing him, and accepts Khalid after seeing his love and chemistry with his mother Nafeesa, inducting him into his special force team, which comprises a few fellow agents, namely one Saurabh (Yash Raj Singh), hacker Aditi (Anupriya Goenka) and fellow agents Prateek and Muthu. Kabir plans his next mission, which is targeted at a criminal mastermind and terrorist-cum-businessman Rizwan Illiyasi. The mission nearly succeeds with the team overpowering Illiyasi, but when he proclaims to Kabir that there is a mole in his team who is fully loyal to his terrorist cause, the agents giving Kabir's team company are suddenly shot down by Saurabh, who, it turns out, is the defector, as he was blinded by greed and had accepted Illiyasi's offer of nearly $100 million to betray his country. An enraged Khalid leaves the spot and chases Saurabh, whose act of shooting the guards supporting the agents results in a deadly shootout. Kabir tries his best to stop Khalid, but in vain. On the other hand, Kabir, who nearly succeeds in shooting Illiyasi, is suddenly shot unconscious by Illiyasi's henchmen.<br><br>

            Kabir wakes up to find himself seriously handicapped while he finds Khalid on the bed, having been supposedly recovered unconscious by the army on the shore. Eventually, he turns rogue, and the story shifts back to present day, wherein Khalid struggles to find Kabir but fails, and is nearly taken off the case when another agent is murdered, though he convinces Sunil and Sherna to give him one last chance, and it is at this point when he finds Kabir briefly and learns about the latter's next target, Dr. Utpal Biswas, that he realizes that Kabir is actually targeting associates of Illiyasi, Biswas, and Naidu being among those responsible, and is on an undercover mission to recover a secret document that Illiyasi badly needs. However, even after this, when he is unable to prevent Biswas from being killed, a furious Khalid gives chase to Kabir, who escapes again.<br><br>

            Later, it is shown that Kabir has been on a holiday, and frequently gives company to a young girl named Roohi. He reminisces about Roohi's single mother Naina, who he had started a relationship with in order to make her a perfect civilian asset. Upon learning of his true identity, Naina was mistrustful and hesitant to help him but agreed for her five-year-old daughter's sake. Kabir assured Naina of her safety, to which the latter replied that she has lost all her faith in him. However, during Naina's mission to spy on Illiyasi's associate Firoze Contractor, an initially confident Kabir, who actually had been in touch with Aditi all along, suddenly finds out that among Illiyasi's many contacts was a plastic surgeon, Dr. Mallika Singhal, who had previously helped Illiyasi with plastic surgery. Realizing that Contractor is actually a disguised Illiyasi, he rushes to Naina's aid but is too late to save her life.
            <br><br>
            Presently, Khalid traces Kabir through Roohi to a Christmas party in the winding, and they have a brief discussion at Kabir's hideout when they are suddenly attacked. Both of them fight off the attackers and make it to Aditi's wedding in Kerala, whereupon they receive the drive with the secret code that Illiyasi needs. However, while Kabir hands over the drive to Khalid and they celebrate on a boat, he is later poisoned while sharing a drink with Khalid, who is revealed to actually be Saurabh.
            <br><br>
            A flashback to the chase between Khalid and Saurabh shows Khalid being shot dead by Illiyasi, following which Saurabh undergoes plastic surgery to disguise himself as Khalid. As part of the scheme, Illiyasi's henchmen shoot Saurabh so he can be recovered by the Indian Army. In the present, Saurabh throws the poisoned and seemingly helpless Kabir into a river.
            <br><br>
            Saurabh returns to his headquarters – a fully armed weapons ship which houses Illiyasi – and launches an anti-satellite missile to destroy the Indian military satellite monitoring the Indo-Pakistani border that supports communications for Indian military forces in remote areas. Just as the missile takes off, Kabir parachutes aboard and single-handedly attacks the ship, eliminating Illyasi's army and confronts Saurabh, revealing that he had known that the latter was not Khalid, having seen him aim and shoot in a way which Khalid couldn't do due to a vision impairment, and also for his choice to drink alcohol, considered forbidden by Khalid. Hence, he put Aditi to spy on him and had acquired an antidote for the poison in his drink. Deciding Illiyasi has become expendable, Saurabh shoots him dead in the ensuing confrontation and flees. Kabir gives chase to Saurabh and overpowers him after an intense fight in a church. The church's dome collapses on Saurabh, killing him.
            <br><br>
            The intelligence agency honors Khalid posthumously for his sacrifice, with Nafeesa receiving an award from the President. Kabir still believed by the public to be a deserter, spends some family time with Roohi, and continues with his next undercover mission after a brief conversation with his boss.<br><br>
