        <span>Plot</span>
        <p>
            The film starts with Advait Thakur fighting with other prisoners and snatching a bracelet that he holds dear. The scene changes to a man in a toilet, using drugs and then murdering the bar owner, Tony. He is known as killer cop Inspector Anjaney Agash. He suddenly gets a call from Advait who informs him of an upcoming murder.<br><br>

            During a Christmas dinner party at home, a seemingly honest cop, Michael Rodrigues finds out that his wife, Teresa is having an affair with another man. He leaves the dinner party and gets a call from the office, informing him about a murder. Michael learns that the victim is Victor Himanshu Tandon, a good friend/coworker of his, and he goes to investigate further. There he meets Inspector Agashe and talks to him, who disagrees with Michael since he wants to kill the murderer, while Michael wants to catch and imprison the murderer. <br><br>

            Meanwhile in the flashback 5 years before, after meeting at a rave party in Goa, Advait Thakur and Sara Nambiar run away together after the party becomes chaotic, due to which the police intervene. After sharing an intimate moment, they decide to embark on a journey away from their family and friends to live a life unshackled like vagabonds. They meet Jessie, who had previously come to Goa, becoming a drug addict and a prostitute to earn money for buying more drugs. Over time, Advait and Sara fall for each other and Sara finds out one day that she is pregnant with Advait's child. At another rave party, Sara watches a girl named Vani talking on the phone, who happens to be daughter of Inspector Agashe, but she hangs up. Inspector Agashe gatecrashes the same party, after getting a tip about drug dealers. Crossfire ensues where Vani gets shot and Agashe is heartbroken. He later indulges in drug addiction and becomes a cop who has no mercy toward criminals. Sara, who was also at the same rave party, sees Vani getting shot and Agashe's outburst of grief and tells Advait that she is pregnant and will not abort the baby. The next morning, having a fear of developing heart-breaking relationships, Advait leaves Sara and Goa, and continues his journey.<br><br>

            At the end of the flashback, Jessie is helping Advait, and he kills another cop Nitin Salgaonkar. He also claims the life of his next target Deven Shivaji Jadhav in a football stadium. As the police were on the way to the stadium, Michael sees Jessie and follows her. Realizing that Michael is following her, Jessie tries to burn the evidence. Michael sees that he is also one of those on Advait's Hit-List. Advait, in the meanwhile, surrenders himself to Agashe.<br><br>

            In the interrogation room, conversation ensues between Michael and Advait. In the past, Michael was abused by his mother who used to hit him, while his father used to hit his mother. Due to the physical abuse he endured, he started feeling uneasy sexually. Michael is about to marry Teresa and feels uncomfortable when she suddenly touches him. Later, he gets frustrated when his friends talk about having sexual experiences would make him a man and not knowing so would make him 'less than a man'. He goes to Jessie's house as she was a prostitute. Unknown to him, Sara has been living with Jessie after Advait left. Michael tries to rape Sara and at that moment Advait returns realizing his mistake and that he loves Sara, intervenes and knocks out Michael and calls the police. Michael's friends, Nitin, Deven and Victor come to investigate and take Sara and Advait in the police van to the station. At that moment Advait and Sara reconcile, and Advait promises to never leave her and their child ever again. Michael wakes up from his unconsciousness and plots to frame both of them for drug peddling. However, Michael injects a lethal dose of a heavy drug to Sara in order to kill her and then throws her from the bridge. Advait also gets injected with the drug and sentenced to 5 years in jail. Still shocked by Sara's death, he prepares himself to seek revenge.<br><br>

            In the present day, Michael confesses his crimes to Advait and that he also killed Jessie. He tells him that killing her made him felt like a man and instigates Advait into a fight with him and cunningly makes Inspector Agashe plan his encounter. However, before leaving Michael says something to Agashe, making him realize that Michael is the last target. Inspector Agashe takes Advait to the same bridge where it all started, to kill him. There Advait tells him that Michael and his friends killed the only family he had. Michael goes to home and sees that his wife is about to leave him and elope with Charlie, the man she is having an affair with. Michael develops a psychotic steak and plans to murder his wife and frame Charlie for the crime. He clutches his hands around Teresa's throat and begins to choke her. When he is about to strangle Teresa to death, he is suddenly injected with something. When he turns behind, a person stands, wearing the same Red Hoodie Advait had worn. That person is revealed to be Sara, who fortunately survived the fall with the help of Jessie. However, the baby couldn't survive.<br><br>

            Over the course of 5 years, Sara had been planning for revenge and coincidentally Advait had been preparing himself for the same. The murders were committed by both Sara and Advait to seek vengeance for the death of their unborn child. Inspector Agashe reluctantly releases Advait as there was no evidence found against him. The film concludes with a happy ending. Sara and Advait, reconcile, find peace and start a new love life.<br><br>
